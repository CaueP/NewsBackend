[{"title": "Kaspersky to US: Check Our Source Code", "text": "Cybersecurity expert Eugene Kaspersky has volunteered to turn over his company's software source code to allay fears about possible ties with the Russian government, The Australian reported last week. Kaspersky made the offer public at CeBIT Australia.\n\nSome U.S. officials have expressed concerns that Kaspersky Lab might have a close working relationship with the Russian government.\n\nKaspersky five years ago replaced a number of high-level managers with people who had ties to Russia's military or intelligence services, Bloomberg reported in 2015.\n\nSome of them reportedly have provided data from the 400 million customers using Kaspersky's software to Russia's intelligence agency, the FSB.\n\nAlso, Kaspersky himself reportedly visits saunas with Russian officials on a regular basis.\n\nKaspersky studied at a university backed by the KGB -- the precursor of the FSB -- in the 1980s, according to reports, and he served as a software engineer with Soviet military intelligence before leaving for the private sector.\n\nThe heads of five U.S. intelligence agencies recently expressed suspicions regarding Kaspersky Lab to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, but they \"don't have an option due to political reasons,\" Kaspersky suggested on Reddit.\n\n\"Recently, inaccurate statement and claims about Kaspersky Lab have circulated in public,\" the company said in a statement provided to TechNewsWorld by corporate communications manager Denise Bertrand.\n\n\"Eugene never worked for the Russian government,\" Kapersky Lab contended. \"He grew up in the Soviet Union era when almost every education opportunity was sponsored by the government in some manner.\"\n\nThe university Kaspersky studied at \"was sponsored by four state institutions, one of which was the KGB,\" Kaspersky Lab said. He was placed at a Russian Ministry of Defense scientific institute as a software engineer upon graduating, because \"it was routine for university faculty to determine students' post-graduate positions.\"\n\nStirring a Hornet's Nest\n\nKaspersky did itself no favors with its all-out pursuit of hackers and malware authors linked to the U.S.\n\nIt has uncovered sophisticated malware or spyware connected to U.S. intelligence sources, including Stuxnet, Flame, Shamoon, and The Equation Group.\n\nKaspersky didn't seem to look equally hard for state-sponsored malware released by Russia, an acknowledged haven for cybercriminals.\n\nPossibly because of that, and also because of the controversy surrounding Russia's possible meddling in the U.S. presidential elections, Kaspersky now is under the microscope.\n\nThe FBI is looking into Kaspersky's ties with the Russian government, as is the Senate.\n\nSeparately, the NSA and the UK's GCHQ reportedly have been trying to hack into Kaspersky for years.\n\nIs Kaspersky Targeted Unfairly?\n\nThe NSA could be behind the latest scrutiny of Kaspersky Lab and its CEO.\n\n\"It's always dangerous to piss off three-letter agencies,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group.\n\n\"Doing so while operating out of Russia would be even more problematic,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of Kaspersky maintaining a wall between its work with the FSB and Russian government, and its work with other clients is effectively zero,\" said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan.\n\nLike a John LeCarre Novel\n\nThe situation is \"like a John LeCarre novel come to life,\" said Laura DiDio, principal analyst at ITIC.\n\n\"You're not going to be able to prove absolutely whether or not Kaspersky has ties to the Russian government, she told TechNewsWorld.\n\n\"He has done all he can do -- offer to give the U.S. government his source code,\" she pointed out.\n\n\"The problem isn't whether Russia built a back door into the Kaspersky code, but that Russia may have copies of the source code,\" Jude told TechNewsWorld.\n\n\"Regardless of whom Kaspersky turns his code over to, his reputation is shot,\" Jude said. \"If it's Russia, the U.S. market is dead; if it's the U.S., then just about every non-U.S. market is dead.\"\n\nRichard Adhikari has been an ECT News Network reporter since 2008.

New co-streaming functionality will allow four PC streamers to combine their respective broadcasts into a single split-screen stream. This feature soon will roll out to Xbox gamers as well.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft announced that it has launched new Mixer Create mobile apps for Android and iOS devices. They are currently in beta, but both will support self-broadcasting and the ability to stream mobile games soon.\n\nThere also will be a Mixer page on the Xbox One Dashboard, which will feature some of the most unique and popular streams curated by a dedicated support team. This will further showcase the variety of diverse, creative content from the streaming community. Moreover, Microsoft's Mixer will feature the always-on, moderated Channel One that allows users to see the breadth of content available across the platform.\n\nFurther, Mixer will serve as a gamer's eye to Microsoft's E3 2017 press conference on June 11.\n\nBeam It Up\n\nMicrosoft acquired Beam last August, only some eight months after its launch, to compete against game streaming on Amazon's Twitch and YouTube.\n\nWhen it launched, Beam attempted to differentiate itself from the competition by providing online competitions that could be streamed in real time. That helped it attract an audience, not to mention interest from Microsoft.\n\nNow the newly branded Mixer could allow Microsoft to capture a segment of the gaming audience that likes to watch rather than actually play today's most popular titles.\n\n\"Microsoft necessarily has to compete but has been on the back foot in the live-streaming space,\" said Joost van Dreunen, principal analyst at SuperData Research.\n\n\"With the rebranding and hopefully a continued development effort, Microsoft has created an opportunity for itself, albeit it slim,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\n\n\"Historically, network-based strategies such as these are challenging, because neither content creators nor viewers are keen on switching platforms,\" added van Dreunen. \"So Microsoft will have to come up with something unique that will draw people to its service.\"\n\nMixing It Up With the In-Crowd\n\nMicrosoft's efforts suggest that it may be aiming for a virtual mixer-style gaming party. However, gamers already have numerous options to meet up and engage, and co-op gameplay may not be enough to draw in new users.\n\n\"Crowd play is interesting, but the application has to be engaging in order to found a long-term role,\" cautioned Steve Bailey, senior analyst for games at IHS Markit.\n\n\"A handful of PS4 games employed a similar idea a few years back, but it didn't seem to gain much traction, and we're only just beginning to explore the potential of games with meaningful crowd-voting systems,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\n\n\"Novelty alone won't be enough to carry this idea, so Mixer and developers will have to continue working closely to realize its potential,\" Bailey added. \"Mixer will also have to show that it can grow its audience, to make this effort ultimately worthwhile for developers.\"\n\nTaking On the Established Players\n\nA name change from the generic \"Beam\" to the equally generic \"Mixer\" may do little to get gamers off Twitch and YouTube, but the fact that the platform will offer live functionality to the PC and console could help set it apart.\n\n\"From the console perspective, various streaming facilities have been available on PS4 and Xbox One for quite some time now, so the question Mixer has to answer is, why should people use it over, say, Twitch?\" pondered Bailey.\n\n\"Features and superior integration are the first hurdles. ... Co-streaming and crowd play are both interesting ideas, but that brings us to the next set of hurdles -- content that leverages these features in compelling ways,\" Bailey added.\n\n\"Team-based combat games are perfect for co-streaming, and so could fit well with many e-sports titles, as well as a number of key shooter properties on Xbox One,\" he pointed out.\n\nSuperior functionality could be the winning mix for Microsoft, however.\n\n\"Its key differentiators -- interactivity and low-latency -- are strong, and arguably elevate Mixer above rivals like Twitch and YouTube in terms of performance,\" suggested SuperData Research's van Dreunen.\n\n\"We've seen in the past that a higher-quality standard is no match for a platform or format that is more popular,\" he added.\n\n\"Another thing Mixer needs to implement is the ability for players to buy games directly through the service -- via Microsoft's stores -- and for the streamers to take a percentage of any purchases that they trigger,\" said IHS Markit's Bailey. \"Twitch currently offers this, but for PC games only. Mixer could open up that opportunity for Xbox One games.\"\n\nPeter Suciu has been an ECT News Network reporter since 2012.
